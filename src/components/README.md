# Components directory
This directory contains most of your Vue.js Components.  
- Following the [Vue.js Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/), each component should be in its own file.  
- All components are named in PascalCase.
- Basic components are named Base*
- Unique components used only once are named The*
- All sub-components are named starting with the component name they belong to followed by the sub-component name.
