## Pinia
The project uses [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management. Pinia is a lightweight state management library for Vue 3. It is inspired by Vuex and uses a similar API.  

## Stores
The stores are grouped by the domain they belong to. For example, the `BoardStore` contains the state related to the board. The `EquipmentStore` contains the state related to the equipments.  

### Store structure
Each store has the following structure:
```ts
export const useStore = defineStore({
  id: 'storeName',
  state: () => ({
    // state
  }),
  actions: {
    // actions
  },
  getters: {
    // getters
  }
})
```
The id is used by Pinia to connect the store to the devtools. Naming the returned function use... is a convention across composable to make its usage idiomatic.  

## Devtools
It is `highly recommended` to use the [vue-js-devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en) extension to debug the state of the application.  
It contains a Pinia tab which shows the state of the application in details and is an invaluable tool for debugging.
